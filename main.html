	<h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
	<p> Time complexity is a way to estimate the number of steps an algorithm will take, and it's crucial for understanding how algorithms will perform with larger datasets. This helps developers choose the most efficient algorithms for their applications. </p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory or storage space an algorithm uses relative to the size of the input data.
	When we say an algorithm has Space Complexity O(n), it means:
	The memory required grows linearly with the input size n.
	For example, if you're storing all elements of an input array of size n into a new array or a list, you're using additional space proportional to n.
